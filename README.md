# 📊 SocialStats

**SocialStats** analyzes your personal data from multiple social networks and turns it into **clean Excel dashboards**: response delays, messaging activity over time, voice call durations, voice message time, and more.
It also supports **exporting media (Instagram & Snapchat)**, **standardized JSON exports**, **regex-based search**, and **location mapping for Snapchat**.

> [!TIP]
> Don’t forget to check the **"Global"** sheet in the Excel file — it contains more specific and aggregated information.

> [!WARNING]
> Too many contacts = unreadable Excel.
> The program will ask you to define a **minimum number of messages per conversation** so only relevant ones are included.
